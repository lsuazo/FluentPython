    "## Interfaces and Protocols in Python History\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most existing code does not use them at all\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reminder\n",
    "     - Protocols are defined as the informal interfaces that make polymorphism work in dynamic languages\n",
    "     \n",
    "- Every class has an interface\n",
    "     - Set public attributes (\\__getitem\\__) implemented by the class or super\n",
    "     - By defintition, private and protected attributes are not part of the interface\n",
    "     - An interface can be thought of the subset of public methods in a class that allow it to play a specifit role int he system\n",
    "     \n",
    "- Protcol\n",
    "    - An interface seen as a set of methods to fulfill a role\n",
    "    - A class may implement several protocols, each serving a different role\n",
    "        - __Should it?__\n",
    "    -  Protocols are informal interfaces so they cant be enforced\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Digs Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sequences are one of the most fundamental interfaces in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- When pythons sees a \\__getitem\\__ method, it tries to iterate over the object\n",
    "    - This means it also accepts the \"in\" operator even without a \\__contains\\__ method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monkey-Patching to Implement a Protocol at Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "- When following established protocols, chances of leveraging external libraries are improved\n",
    "\n",
    "- random.shuffle gets a sequence as an input\n",
    "    - For this to work a class needs to support item assignment\n",
    "        - \\__setitem\\__ need to be implemented to make a sequence mutable\n",
    "        \n",
    "def set_card(deck, position, card):<br>\n",

    "    - Lets end user declare that a certain class becomes a virtual subclass of an ABC\n",

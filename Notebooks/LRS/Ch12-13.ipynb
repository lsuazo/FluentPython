    "    - in practice, often both. But when often you can replace just the second with composition or delegation\n",
    "2. Make interfaces explicit with ABCs\n",
    "3. Use Mixins for code reuse\n",
    "    - conceptually, a mixin does not define a new type; it merely bundles code for reuse.\n",
    "    - mixin should never be instantiated, and a concrete class should not inherit only from a mixin\n",
    "    - each mixin should provide a specific behavior, implementing few and very closely related methods.\n",
    "4. Make mixinx explicit by naming\n",
    "5. ABC can be a mixin, but not the other way around\n",
    "    - however, abc concrete methods should use only the public interface; while this need not be true of mixin\n",
    "6. Don't subclass from more than one concrete class\n",
    "    - some people say not even one concrete class: \"all non-leaf classes should be abstract\" -Scott Meyer's\n",
    "7. Provide Aggregate classes to Users\n",
    "    - create empty classes that are useful combinations of mixins and/or abcs (called **aggregate classes**)\n",
    "8. VIP: <font color='blue'> Favor object composition over class inheritance </font>\n",
    "    - inheritance is a very tight coupling, and even with single inheritance, tall trees tend to be very brittle \n",

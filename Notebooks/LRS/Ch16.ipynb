    "    - `generator.throw(exc_type[, exc_value[, traceback]])` - causes yield expression where gen was paused to raise exception\n",
    "        - if handled by gen, flow advances to next yield, and value yielded becomes result of throw() call\n",
    "        - if not handled, exception propagates to context of caller\n",
    "    - `generator.close()` - causes yield expression to raise a `GeneratorExit` exception\n",
    "        - No error reported to caller if exeption not handled by gen, or if gen raises StopIteration (usually by running to completion)\n",
    "        - if value is yielded after this, RuntimeError is raised which propagates to caller\n",

    "* first thing yield from x does is call iter(x), so it can be called on any iterable - but it really shines when x is generator.\n",
    "* The main feature of yield from is that it opens a bidirectional channel from the outermost caller, to the innermost subgenerator so that values can be sent and yielded back and forth directly from them, and exceptions can be thrown all the way in without adding a lot of boiler plate in intermediate coroutines.\n",
